    "The dataset comprises binary classification data representing whether small molecules bind to three different protein targets. Each entry includes SMILES representations of molecule structures and binary labels for binding to each protein target. The competition data, provided by Leash Biosciences, consists of approximately **98M** training examples per protein, **200K** validation examples per protein, and **360K** test molecules per protein. *Keep in mind that dataset is very imbalanced:  roughly 0.5% of examples are classified as binders*<br><br>\n",

    "SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a notation system for representing chemical structures in a computer-readable format.

    "* Atoms and Bonds: Atoms are represented by their atomic symbols, with lowercase letters indicating aromatic atoms. Bonds are denoted by symbols (- for single, = for double, # for triple, * for aromatic, and . for disconnected structures).\n",
    "* Simple Chains: Chains of atoms are represented by combining atomic symbols and bond symbols. Hydrogen atoms are suppressed unless explicitly stated.\n",
    "* Branches: Branches from chains are enclosed in parentheses and placed directly after the atom to which they are connected.\n",
    "* Rings: Ring structures are identified by using numbers to denote the opening and closing ring atoms. Different numbers are used for each ring, and bond symbols may precede the ring closure number.\n",
